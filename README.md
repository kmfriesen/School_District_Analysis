# Summary 

- The amount of null values in the dataset changed as there were no null values in the original data. While having lots of null values can lead to inaccuracy, this does not appear to be the case because many parts of the analysis were unchanged.
- Another major change to the analysis was the number of students being analyzed. The number of students in the analysis went down by 461 students (~39100 to ~38700). However, I did not changes the student count in any of the analyses.
- When comparing three different categories for schools, spending per student, type, and size, the bins that Thomas High School is in changed so the averages were slightly lower, however not enough to affect their placement in comparison to the other bins.
- Another change of this analysis is that Thomas High School performed worse in math and reading scores and passsing rates. However, this did not change their position as number two school for highest overall passing rates.
